# T1A3 - Terminal Application

## First idea

As a game lover, I have always wanted to develop a game myself. This time, I want to develop a DND-like text game. It's called "Tiny hero".

The story starts like this: A long, long time ago, in a world of swords and magic, a small land "Tiny" was attacked by an evil dragon. As the last hope to save this tiny land, you were summoned by the king from another world. Now your adventure begins.

The travel map is randomly generated and eventually leads the hero to BOSS, counted by days (MAX 7 DAYS). Depending on the choices you made along the way, the hero will have different equipment. You can buy them in the shop or get them by defeating monsters. Some special events give the hero some changes, such as increasing the maximum HP.

Who makes the first move in battle is decided by the dice. The monster's movement (attack, defence) is decided by dice, the attack effect (miss, half damage, full damage or critical damage) is decided by dice. Combat continues until either monster is defeated or the hero has fled.
Once the hero has been defeated or the hero has defeated the final boss, this game is over.
