# T1A3 - Terminal Application

## First idea

As a game lover, I have always wanted to develop a game myself. This time, I want to develop a DND-like text game. It's called "Tiny hero".

The story starts like this: A long, long time ago, in a world of swords and magic, a small land "Tiny" was attacked by an evil dragon. As the last hope to save this tiny land, you were summoned by the king from another world. Now your adventure begins.

The travel map is randomly generated and eventually leads the hero to BOSS, counted by days (MAX 7 DAYS). Depending on the choices you made along the way, the hero will have different equipment. You can buy them in the shop or get them by defeating monsters. Some special events give the hero some changes, such as increasing the maximum HP.

Who makes the first move in battle is decided by the dice. The monster's movement (attack, defence) is decided by dice, the attack effect (miss, half damage, full damage or critical damage) is decided by dice. Combat continues until either monster is defeated or the hero has fled.
Once the hero has been defeated or the hero has defeated the final boss, this game is over.

R3 Reference list

R4 Repository link

R5 Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application.
  - describe at a high level what the application will do
  - identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
  - identify the target audience
  - explain how a member of the target audience will use it




R6 Three Features

	Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .






R7 	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user



R8 Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML


R9	Develop an implementation plan which:   (TRELLO)
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.



<!-- CODE REQUIREMENT -->
1.
	Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Ruby such as:
- variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Ruby Gem
- using functions from a Ruby Gem

2.
DRY


3.
Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

4.
Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application

5.  GIT PUSH 20 TIME IN  GIT LOG
Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
- pushing all commits to a remote repository


6. 
Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,
- writing a script which turns the application into an executable; OR
- packaging the application for use as a module or dependency
